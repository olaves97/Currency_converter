# Currency_converter
A simple program for currency conversion. 
There is a base currency (EUR) and supported currencies (USD, PLN, GBP) to which we can convert the base currency.

The page that the information about the exchange rates is taken from is https://exchangeratesapi.io/. 

User can check the exchange rate for supported currencies by changing the values of these two parameters, for example:
    currency_to_convert_from = 'PLN'
    currency_to_convert_to = 'USD'
